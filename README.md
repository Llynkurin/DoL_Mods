It is a userscript injection system for *Degrees of Lewdity*. It exists because manually editing a 150MB HTML file is inefficient, chaotic, and frankly, terrifying. DoLlynk sits between your browser and the game, injecting code, styles, and assets into memory *before* the engine initializes. It is much cleaner.
